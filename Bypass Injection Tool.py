Bypass SQL Injection Scanner (Advanced Version)

This script is designed to test advanced SQL injection bypass techniques against login forms or vulnerable endpoints.
It includes support for common logic-based payloads, hash-based bypasses, obfuscation, and supports both GET and POST methods.

ðŸš¨ Disclaimer: This tool is intended for educational and ethical penetration testing purposes only.
Use only on systems you own or have explicit written authorization to test.
