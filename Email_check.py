Email Phishing Analyzer üõ°Ô∏è
---------------------------

This script is designed to analyze the content of email messages and detect potential phishing attempts.
It scans for:
- Suspicious **keywords** commonly used in phishing emails (e.g., "urgent", "click here", "verify account").
- **URLs** pointing to known suspicious or shortened domains (e.g., "bit.ly", "secure-login.com").

How it works:
-------------
1. Reads the contents of an email file (`email_example.rtf`).
2. Extracts all URLs and checks if any belong to a suspicious domain.
3. Searches for phishing-related keywords in the text.
4. Calculates a total **suspicion score**:
   - +2 points per suspicious link.
   - +1 point per phishing keyword.

The script outputs the total score and the exact links/keywords detected.
